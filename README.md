## Workflow Updates
Workflows are versioned in semver just as with regular software, however, the GitHub Action workflows convention is to reference a major version number such that backwards compatible minor and patch updates are received automatically.  This means a separate major tag such as `v1` must be moved after each release.  To move a major tag after a release execute (`v1` shown):

```
git tag -f v1
git push --tags -f
```
